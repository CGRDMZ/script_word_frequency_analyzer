# script_word_frequency_analyzer
This project is about making a program which can analyze movie scripts and find the repeating frequency of words. User has options of providing a script as a ‘txt’ file or as an url to (Imsdb) a website. After the script input is taken, the program can compare two scripts and sort the first twenty common words, or just find word frequencies based on one file.

The aim of the project is people who has a relation with theatre culture, including writers, critics, actors and actresses and hobbyst. The analization of a script can give the user foresight about the movie. Is it a horror movie which probably has words like die, kill, hell and some swear words? Or is it a comedy movie which has a lot of ‘laughs’ in paranthesis. Also, by comparing two files user can predict how much similar are these films.
